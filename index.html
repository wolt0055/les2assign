    <p>The landscape of how content on the internet is viewed has drastically
      diversified since the beginning of (internet) time. Devices come in all
      shapes and sizes, and in such abundance that it is no longer good practice
       to build for one specific platform. In the past, viewing a page on your
       mobile device that was built for a desktop interface did not typically
       end well. Add to that a smorgasbord of browsers for viewing sites, each
        of which may or may not support certain HTML elements and attributes,
         and you've got quite a challenge to be able to reach the masses of users.

          These constraints have driven the need for flexibility built-in to
           websites, something Responsive Web Design (RWD) was created to address.
           The medium of what is being communicated over the internet has expanded
           far beyond its text-centric beginnings. Things like videos, pictures,
            and objects allow for an enriched viewing experience. The ability to
            effectively combine these into a cohesive and appealing site requires
            flexibility in how you create it. RWD equips programmers with tools they
             need to increase accessibility (a11y) and readability for the websites they build.
